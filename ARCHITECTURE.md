# Architecture Guide

## Deployments

The following branch protection rules apply to main: 
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Require a pull request before merging
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Require approvals
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Require status checks to pass before merging
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Require branches to be up to date before merging

Which enables the following process:
1. Create PR against main
1. PR triggers:
    1. Execute automated unit, component and integration tests
    1. Create docker image
    1. Run docker container with image
    1. Execute automated end-to-end testing against docker container
    1. Store docker image using commit hash as a tag
    1. Allow merge to main
1. Approve PR
1. Merge PR (will require other PRs to update)
1. Push (merge) to main triggers:
    1. Deploy related docker image to staging
    1. Execute automated deployment testing against staging
        1. Revert if deployment fails (will require other PRs to update)
        1. üõë END
    1. Tag using SemVer
    1. Add SemVer to docker image's tags
    1. Mark tag for release
    1. Deploy tagged docker image to production
    1. ‚úÖ END
